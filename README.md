# sishuo-java-2048-Game
By sishuo
Created using Java swing with object-oriented design in 2024. I was playing 2048 a lot at the time, and I thought I could create this game in java by myself.
I created all images (.png) by Windows' 3D Painter BY HAND, it was tough to get all of them right.

Packages:
/codes -> all .java files
/images -> all .png files

One can start the game and use arrow keys to move, just like regular 2048. The system will track the score in the background and, if the game ends, a JFrame that contains one's final score will pop out.
